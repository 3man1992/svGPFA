# Python implementation of Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (svGPFA) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joacorapela/gaussianProcesses.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joacorapela/svGPFA)

Tested with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/) and [Pytorch 1.3.0](https://pytorch.org/).

* Documentation can be found [here](https://svgpfa.readthedocs.io/)
* A script running svGPFA on simulated data can be found at [scripts/demoPointProcess.py](scripts/demoPointProcess.py).
* The source code can be found under [src](src).
* Test cases can be found under [ci](ci) and the history of running these test can be accessed by clicking on the badge in the title.
