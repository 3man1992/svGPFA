# Python implementation of Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (svGPFA) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joacorapela/gaussianProcesses.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joacorapela/svGPFA)

Tested with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/) and [Pytorch 1.2.0](https://pytorch.org/).

* A Jupyter notebook running svGPFA on simulated data can be found at [ipynb/demoPointProcess.ipynb](ipynb/demoPointProcess.ipynb).
* A script running svGPFA on simulated data can be found at [scripts/demoPointProcess.py](scripts/demoPointProcess.py).
* The source code can be found under [src](src).
* The class diagram can be found at [doc/design/Classes.pdf](doc/design/Classes.pdf).
* Comprehensive unit tests can be found under [ci](ci).
